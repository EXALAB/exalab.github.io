Long time ago, when the highest Android version is Lollipop, and most of the Android device ram won't higher than 3GB, it is hard to think about, running something that require high ram consumption such as [GNOME or KDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/5l39tz/linux_distros_ram_consumption_comparison_updated/). However time has changed a lot, in today world, most of the Android device come with 4GB ram, so it is time to change, I will start to experiment about running HEAVIER DE on AnLinux distro, this include [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/), [KDE](https://kde.org/), and maybe, [Cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(software)), this is the spoiler for next month release, stay tuned :)

Working on translation and new release of AnLinux, which is a pain in the ass, I need to move all the text in .java file to strings.xml, and pack new BackBox distro, however it will be release soon, stay tuned.

I bought a new phone on 7 Febuary 2019, because my old Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime is broken. The new phone is the [Global Mi 8 Lite](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-8-lite/), everything is awesome, Processor, GPU, Audio, and price is cheap too. But still have a little drawback, unlocking Bootloader required 360 Hours of waiting (This really surprise me). It is somehow annoying for me who develop root required apps. So, the development proccess would be pause for a while, until 23 Febuary 2019, sorry for any 
inconvenient caused.
